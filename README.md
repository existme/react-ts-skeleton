# README
This repository serves as a starter template for building React applications with TypeScript. It provides a solid foundation and essential configurations to kickstart your React projects using the TypeScript language and React.

### Install TypeScript
``` shell
npm install -g typescript
```

### React and typescript setup
```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```
### Install ESLint & Prettier
In order to ensure that your code follows the rules of the project or your team, and the style is consistent, itâ€™s recommended you set up ESLint and Prettier. To get them to play nicely, follow these steps to set it up.


``` shell
yarn add eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-react --dev

yarn add prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --dev
```
ESLint will use -> .eslintrc.js

### Cleanup

Remove test and jest, and web-vital dependencies if you don't need them:
``` shell
npm uninstall @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event react-test-renderer web-vitals jest
```
also remove the following files
``` shell
\rm src/setupTests.ts src/reportWebVitals.ts src/App.test.tsx 
```
